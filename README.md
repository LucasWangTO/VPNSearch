# VPNSearch
Add a free API Key from Auth0 to make it work.

## Description
This Firefox Extension checks your IP Address against Auth0 to see if it has been blacklisted, and redirects your search to DDG from Google if the score is below 0.

## Uses
Using a VPN may result in Unusual Traffic Alert which results in having to solve a captcha, but DDG doesn't need this.

## How to Install
Go to about:addons on Firefox and install the extension from a file.
